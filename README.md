## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

## Week 1
My idea for my clock sketch was to represent the hour hand as a segment that is uncovered and the minute hand is shown on the outside of the clock. In this example the time is 8:10

## Week 2
This is my clock so far I have been playing around with mapping sin and cos functions to create cool effects. I plan on making my alarm do something with z axis rotation and colours

## Week 3
I have been working on my alarm, I have found it difficult to make both my main clock and my alarm look good because I find that each time I improve one the other one gets worse. I have now got my alarm to a point where I am pretty happy with however I still need to work on my actually clock and work out how I will make it display the time. For seconds I will have it pulse and for hours I will use the circles around the house but I still need to find a way to represent minutes and display which circle is currently active.
